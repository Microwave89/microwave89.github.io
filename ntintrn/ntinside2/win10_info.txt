===ntoskrnl.exe unexpectedly showing up in explorer.exe loaded module list===
At least when running Windows 10 10240 or 10586 if we list the loaded modules of explorer.exe
we notice it has loaded "ntoskrnl.exe" after a while. This is somewhat unexpected since ntoskrnl.exe
is the Windows kernel and there doesn't exist any obvious reason, except maybe in case
of a security breach, for it to be loaded into explorer.exe.
Most of ntoskrnl.exe code is code that can only be executed in ring 0 mode anyways.

The root cause of this behavior is the "Windows.Internal.Shell.Broker.dll" file which is statically
linked against ntoskrnl.exe in order to import the HviGetHypervisorFeatures, HviIsAnyHypervisorPresent, and _purecall
functions. All three functions don't contain any instructions which can't be executed in user mode.

We can block loading of ntoskrnl.exe without encountering any side effects by installing a pre-callback on NtOpenFile
and NtCreateFile which checks file name for substring "ntoskrnl" and if found performs the following operations:

--> Set IO_STATUS_BLOCK::Information to 0
--> Set IO_STATUS_BLOCK::Status to STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND
--> Set hFile to NULL
--> Return "STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND"


Anti telemetry and "senseless forced maintenance"
-DeviceCensus
-CompatTelRunner
-SearchFilterHost
-SearchIndexer
-SearchProtocolHost
-Bt???
-MRT
-MpCmdRun
-cleanmgr
-Defrag
-SkypeHost (cannot be renamed in WindowsApps folder --> must be deleted instead)


Further thoughts on telemetry and maintenance:
- Schedule service provides maintenance, but it cannot be disabled using msconfig, and it cannot be stopped using Windows APIs.
	But in registry we may rename value "Type" to "PsProcessType" and "Start" to "DriverStartIo" effectively preventing it from running.

- Disabling everything related to telemetry in gpedit does not do much, we must disable all related services using above method instead.
  Disabling WER does not show any differences upon program crash.
  Programs/key names that can be disabled without side effects as follows:
	DiagTrack
	MessagingService
	OneSyncSvc
	PcaSvc
	PimIndexMaintenanceSvc
	Schedule
	TieringEngineService	
	UnistoreSvc
	UserDataSvc
	WbioSvc
	wercplsupport
	WerSvc
	
  Services listed below must not be touched and are needed for OS operation so far.
	CoreMessagingRegistrar
	tiledatamodelsvc
	

Apps:
Many built-in apps can be uninstalled doing a right click on the app icon in Start menu --> all apps list.
